# tic-tac-toe-game
## The project
This project is a two player game 

## Goals
1) create factory functions 
2) understand IIFE

## What I learnt 
1) i learnt the basics of the module pattern 

## Challanges faced
some of challanges I encountered in this project was checking if a players move was valid as that grid item may already be occupied. <br/>
To solve this I just gave each a grid item a class called  'used' when it had been initally selected. Also I created a function that checks 
if the grid item being selected contains the class 'used'.
